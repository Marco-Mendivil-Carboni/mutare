  abstract = {We study a generalization of Kelly’s horse model to situations where gambling on horses other than the winning horse does not lead to a complete loss of the investment. In such cases, the odds matrix is non-diagonal, which is particularly interesting for biological applications. We examine the trade-off between the mean growth rate and its asymptotic variance, an approximation for risk. Because the consequences of fluctuations around the average growth rate are asymmetric, we further explore a better alternative definition of risk: the extinction probability and its implications for Kelly gambling and the risk-return trade-off. We discuss some applications of these concepts in biology and ecology.},

  abstract = {Kelly's criterion is a betting strategy that maximizes the long term growth rate, but which is known to be risky. Here, we find optimal betting strategies that gives the highest capital growth rate while keeping a certain low value of risky fluctuations. We then analyze the trade-off between the average and the fluctuations of the growth rate, in models of horse races, first for two horses then for an arbitrary number of horses, and for uncorrelated or correlated races. We find an analog of a phase transition with a coexistence between two optimal strategies, where one has risk and the other one does not. The above trade-off is also embodied in a general bound on the average growth rate, similar to thermodynamic uncertainty relations. We also prove mathematically the absence of other phase transitions between Kelly's point and the risk free strategy.},
