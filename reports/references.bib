  abstract = {We study a generalization of Kelly’s horse model to situations where gambling on horses other than the winning horse does not lead to a complete loss of the investment. In such cases, the odds matrix is non-diagonal, which is particularly interesting for biological applications. We examine the trade-off between the mean growth rate and its asymptotic variance, an approximation for risk. Because the consequences of fluctuations around the average growth rate are asymmetric, we further explore a better alternative definition of risk: the extinction probability and its implications for Kelly gambling and the risk-return trade-off. We discuss some applications of these concepts in biology and ecology.},

  abstract = {How can a cell maintain itself as a living being? Living cells, shaped by billions of years of evolution, have developed many ways to adapt to their environment in order to thrive and to maximize their chance for survival. Cell metabolism is shaped by the rules of physics and chemistry, which enforce boundaries on what cells can achieve. But within these boundaries, we can still ask how cells should allocate their resources. By looking at cells through this economic lens, we may uncover some general design principles that characterize life. In our textbook, to which everyone is invited to contribute, we give an overview of established approaches and topics in cellular economics, from descriptions of simple metabolic systems to cell growth, variability, and dynamic behavior.

  abstract = {Kelly's criterion is a betting strategy that maximizes the long term growth rate, but which is known to be risky. Here, we find optimal betting strategies that gives the highest capital growth rate while keeping a certain low value of risky fluctuations. We then analyze the trade-off between the average and the fluctuations of the growth rate, in models of horse races, first for two horses then for an arbitrary number of horses, and for uncorrelated or correlated races. We find an analog of a phase transition with a coexistence between two optimal strategies, where one has risk and the other one does not. The above trade-off is also embodied in a general bound on the average growth rate, similar to thermodynamic uncertainty relations. We also prove mathematically the absence of other phase transitions between Kelly's point and the risk free strategy.},

In clonal populations, this may be achieved through sensing followed by response or through the generation of diversity by stochastic phenotype switching. Here we show that stochastic switching can be favored over sensing when the environment changes infrequently. The optimal switching rates then mimic the statistics of environmental changes. We derive a relation between the long-term growth rate of the organism and the information available about its fluctuating environment.},

  abstract = {Bacterial persistence (phenotypic tolerance to antibiotics) provides a prime example of bet-hedging, where normally growing cells generate slow-growing but antibiotic-tolerant persister cells to survive through periods of exposure to antibiotics. The population dynamics of persistence is explained by a phenotype switching mechanism that allows individual cells to switch between these different cellular states with different environmental sensitivities. Here, we perform a theoretical study based on an exact solution for the case of a periodic variation of the environment to address how phenotype switching emerges and under what conditions switching is or is not beneficial for long-time growth. Specifically we report a bifurcation through which a fitness maximum and minimum emerge above a threshold in the duration of exposure to the antibiotic. Only above this threshold, the optimal phenotype switching rates are adjusted to the time scales of the environment, as emphasized by previous theoretical studies, while below the threshold a non-switching population is fitter than a switching one. The bifurcation can be of different type, depending on how the phenotype switching rates are allowed to vary. If the switching rates for both directions of the switch are coupled, the transition is discontinuous and results in evolutionary hysteresis, which we confirm with a stochastic simulation. If the switching rates vary individually, a continuous transition is obtained and no hysteresis is found. We discuss how both scenarios can be linked to changes in the underlying molecular networks.},
